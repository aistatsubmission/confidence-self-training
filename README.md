# Confidence-Filtered Self-Training under Domain Adaptation

This repository provides experiments to **visualize gradual domain adaptation with pseudo-labeling**.
We implement **Confidence-Filtered Self-Training (CFSTDA)** and **Margin-Filtered Self-Training (MFSTDA)** 
using two synthetic datasets:
- **2D Gaussian mixture with rotation**
- **Two-Moons dataset with rotation**
